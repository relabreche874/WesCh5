# WesDataWrangling

notebook for ch 6, 7, & 8 


This lab is a repo for your work on Wes McKinney's book "Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Ed." for the three chapters that relate to the *Data Wrangling* portions of the book.

Remember:
 __Munge/munging/WRANGLING__
    Describes the overall process of manipulating unstructured and/or messy data into a structured or   clean form. The word has snuck its way into the jargon of many modern-day data hackers. “Munge” rhymes with “grunge.”

AT THIS point, you know the drill with labs like this one, having done Ch5 and Ch4. I have added the data files associated with the book in the `examples` folder, so you should be able to type in
`data = pd.read_csv('examples/macrodata.csv')` and it should work.

As for each of the chapters in this series, I want you follow the "Coding The Hard Way" methodology. (See Below)

SO for this lab, I'd like to you to follow along with the chapter((s), typing in the code lines into your jupyter notebook within this repo. You should also add *markdown notes* about which section of the chapter the code refers. I'd suspect that there may be times when there is not enough information to perform the example, but Wes is pretty good at making sure you can follow along with the examples and get the same results.

The finished notebooks will have all the inputs, outputs and graphs form following along in the chapters. 

BE SURE to commit at the end of every subsection, and push just about as often. Remember, commits and pushes are _FREE_ so use them liberally!

So to be clear, move through chapters, typing in the inputs, running the code, getting the output. Add *Markdown Cells* when you want to comment a section or subsection.

Submit the lab when you're done.

## Coding The Hard Way

Zed A. Shaw is a popular author of several books where he
describes learning a programming language The Hard Way.
Zed suggests, and we at Zip Code agree with him wholeheartedly, that the best, most impactful, highest return for
your investment when learning to code, is _type the code
using your own fingers_.

That’s right. Whether you are a "visual learner", a "video
learner", or someone who can read textbooks like novels
(are there any more of these out there?), the best way to
learn to code is to code and to code by typing out the code
with your own fingers. This means you DO NOT do a lot of
copy and paste of code blocks; you really put in the work,
making your brain better wired to code by coding with
your own typing of the code.
