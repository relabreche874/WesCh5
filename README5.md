# WesCh5 Getting Started with pandas

notebook for ch5


This lab is a repo for your work on Wes McKinney's book "Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Ed." in Chapter 5, _Getting Started with pandas_.

As for each of the chapters in this series, I want you follow the "Coding The Hard Way" methodology. (See Below)

SO for this lab, I'd like to you to follow along with the chapter, typing in the code lines into your jupyter notebook within this repo. You should also add *markdown notes* about which section of the chapter the code refers. I'd suspect that there may be times when there is not enough information to perform the example, but Wes is pretty good at making sure you can follow along with the examples and get the same results.

The finished notebook will have all the inputs, outputs and graphs form following along in the chapter. There will be other labs where you'll have to do the same steps from some of the sections ona *different data set* than the one in the text. so you'll have TWO notebooks in those labs.

BE SURE to commit at the end of every subsection, and push just about as often. Remember, commits and pushes are _FREE_ so use them liberally!

So to be clear, move through Chapter 5, typing in the inputs, running the code, getting the output. Add *Markdown Cells* when you want to comment a section or subsection.

Submit the lab when you're done.

## Coding The Hard Way

Zed A. Shaw is a popular author of several books where he
describes learning a programming language The Hard Way.
Zed suggests, and we at Zip Code agree with him wholeheartedly, that the best, most impactful, highest return for
your investment when learning to code, is _type the code
using your own fingers_.

Thatâ€™s right. Whether you are a "visual learner", a "video
learner", or someone who can read textbooks like novels
(are there any more of these out there?), the best way to
learn to code is to code and to code by typing out the code
with your own fingers. This means you DO NOT do a lot of
copy and paste of code blocks; you really put in the work,
making your brain better wired to code by coding with
your own typing of the code.
